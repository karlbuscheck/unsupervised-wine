# Unsupervised Wine

## Project Overview

The curse of dimensionality: When datasets have tons of features, it becomes nearly impossible for ML models to generalize effectively or uncover real structure. In this notebook, we'll use the popular `load_wine` [dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_wine.html) from Scikit-Learn to explore how Principal Component Analysis, or PCA, can be utilized to beat this curse.

We'll see how PCA can:
- Cluster messy datasets without labels
- Supercharge pipelines for classification models like Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Go head-to-head with a supervised decision tree -- a showdown that underscores the power of unsupervised learning techniques in the real world when labels are so often missing
